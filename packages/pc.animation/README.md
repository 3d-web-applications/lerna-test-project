This package was uploaded to test capabilities of Lerna.
If you like to test the workflow by yourself, checkout [this repository](https://github.com/3d-web-applications/lerna-test-project).
Inside the package you will find a single [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) script.
By attaching it to an entity in your PlayCanvas hierarchy, the entity will change its height over time.
